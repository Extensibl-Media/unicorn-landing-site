## 1. What information does Unicorn Landing collect?

Unicorn Landing is an online dating service where members can search for other members and communicate with them.

### 1.1. Registration Information

To join Unicorn Landing, you will have to complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us with information about you such as:
- your name and nickname
- your email address
- your gender
- the gender of your preferred matches
- your date of birth
- your location details
- your profile photo

You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing 'My profile' page and 'Email settings' page, which gives you the chance to correct or update your information at any time, except for your gender and date of birth.

### 1.2. Additional Data

This is the list of additional data we may have on you:
- answers to non-mandatory profile questions
- photo, video, and audio files that you upload to the site or add to your favorites
- your banners
- your wall posts, both on your own wall, and on the walls of other members
- your comments to wall posts, uploads, news articles, etc.
- events and companion ads you have created
- IDs of objects you have liked (uploads, wall posts, etc.)
- ratings you have given other members
- your answers to polls
- every message that you send on the site (in the mailbox, messenger, etc.)

### 1.3. Site Visitors

Does Unicorn Landing collect my personal data if I am not a member and just visit the site?

No. We do not collect any personal data about visitors to our site. If you do visit us without becoming a member, we will place session ID cookies on your computer.

### 1.4. Mobile App Usage

What does Unicorn Landing collect about me if I use the mobile app?

Unicorn Landing offers you the opportunity to stay in touch with the contacts you've made, no matter where you are.

We may ask you to allow us access to your location information, including latitude and longitude. This information lets you search for other members in a certain radius from your current location. You can disable the permission by going to your phone Settings > Location > Disable tracking or similar.

### 1.5. Payment Information

What information is collected from me if I pay for your services?

We do not collect any financial information nor your chosen payment method. Please note that while we do not store any credit card or other payment card details, our payment service providers may do so.

### 1.6. Social Network Integration

Can Unicorn Landing collect information about me from other sites I use, such as Facebook?

If you have registered on our website or app via a social network (such as Facebook), we will connect your profile in your service with your profile on the social network website for your convenience, to let you use this sign on option further. The information that we request includes basic details such as your name, gender, date of birth, and email address. However, we may only collect the information that you have made publicly available on your social network profile, and we will ask you to answer the rest of the mandatory profile questions separately in the case we have not been able to collect it from your social network profile.

In order to revoke access, please visit the application settings on your social network profile and follow the instructions to remove the access permissions.

## 2. How do you use the information, and who do you share it with?

### 2.1. Purpose of Data Collection

Why does Unicorn Landing have to collect all this information?

The Unicorn Landing online dating service is designed to make it easy for you to find, connect and interact with other members by posting information about yourself and seeing what other people have shared about themselves.

### 2.2. Considerations for Sharing Personal Information

What should I consider before disclosing personal information about myself?

When using our service, you should assume that anything you post or submit will be publicly viewable and accessible. We recommend and encourage you to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. Please remember that photos or video files that you post on Unicorn Landing may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.

When you post information about yourself or use the messaging services, any personal data you choose to share is shared at your own risk.

We may start sharing anonymized data for advertising purposes, but only after we receive explicit consent from you.

We may be required by law to share your data with government or law enforcement agencies. We will cooperate with government or law enforcement inquiries from within or outside your country of residence. This may include disclosing your personal data to government or law enforcement agencies, or private parties when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is required by law or when we, in our discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
